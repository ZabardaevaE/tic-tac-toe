## :rocket: Cool tech
- Programming languages I use were:
 HTML + CSS;
 JavaScript

## :scream: Bugs to fix :poop:
- The reset function required more work as it is only delete information but do not restart the game. Restart button is working propely now!

## :sob: Lessons learnt
- I require better time management to finish the project and more practice.

## :white_check_mark: Future features
- I could add reload function and some animation
